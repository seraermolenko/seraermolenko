# Hi, I'm Sera! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year computer science student at SFU with an interest in **data engineering** and **DevOps**. I have experience with architecting data pipelines and data analysis as well as well as optimizing system performance, implementing cloud solutions, and automating workflows. 

Outside of my classes, I enjoy working on passion projects such as Bloom and contributing to SFUâ€™s Team Phantom. I really enjoy learning, applying what I learn and being involved in my community!


## What I've Been Working On:
