# Hi, I'm Sera! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year computer science student at SFU with an interest in **data engineering** and **DevOps**. I have experience with architecting data pipelines and data analysis as well as well as optimizing system performance, implementing cloud solutions, and automating workflows. 

Passionate about building scalable and efficient systems, I leverage technologies like Docker, AWS, Kafka, CAN and PostgreSQL to streamline data management and improve operational efficiency.  I also have experience with Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration, and Iâ€™ve worked on CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing, deployment, and integration processes.

Outside of my classes, I enjoy working on passion projects such as Bloom and contributing to SFUâ€™s Team Phantom. I really enjoy learning, applying what I learn and being involved in my community!
